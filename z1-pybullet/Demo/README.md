# How to use the arm to play golf:golf:

In this folder, we can teach the arm how to play golf.:golf:

:blush:if you are a technical programmer, you can change the ball position and the demonstration from the code directly. The "generate_initial_traj"  code file contains the code for generating demonstration and the "robot_model.py"  code file contains the code for all models used in pybullet. Enjoy your teaching time!:heart_eyes:

:yum:If you are not good at coding, we also prepare a plan B for you to enjoy the project. You can use the code file "traj_record.py"â€‹ to teach the arm hand-by-hand by using your mouse to drag it.
